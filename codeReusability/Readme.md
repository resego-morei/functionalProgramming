# Code Reusability

The main use of functions is the ability to reuse code and create lightweight programs.

Code reusability refers to the practice of writing code in a way that allows it to be used again in different parts of a program or in different projects. This can be achieved through various techniques such as:

- **Modularization**: Breaking down code into smaller, self-contained modules or functions that can be easily reused.
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: Using pre-written code libraries and frameworks that provide common functionality.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: In object-oriented programming, using inheritance and polymorphism to create reusable classes and methods.
- **Generic Programming**: Writing code that can work with any data type.

Benefits of code reusability include:

- **Reduced Development Time**: Reusing existing code can significantly speed up the development process.
- **Improved Code Quality**: Reusing well-tested code can lead to fewer bugs and more reliable software.
- **Consistency**: Reusing code ensures consistency across different parts of a project or across different projects.

By focusing on code reusability, developers can create more maintainable, scalable, and efficient software.
I willy be illustrating this using ReactJs, which is an industry used framework used for software development.

In react we use functional components which are just plain JavaScript functions that return React elements (JSX) to define how the UI should look.
They are lightweight, simple, and capable of handling state and effects through React Hooks.

They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

We can come across two react components, which are class components and function components. I will be illustrating function components to drive the
concept of code reusability of functions.
